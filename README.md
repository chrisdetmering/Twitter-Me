## Summary

The first CapStone Project of the SDMM program. I wanted to try to implement the Sign In with Twitter OAuth1.1a flow. I made my own custom Twitter API class that handle the OAuth1.1a specs. 

I also used React Hooks to build the client side. learning how to break up my code, keep it moduler, and use functional programming was enjoyable. 

Lastly, I wanted to style it all using CSS, NO CSS frameworks. I wanted to learn to use the basics of CSS (rule declarations, specificity, cascading, etc.) to style my app because I wanted to learn how CSS works under the hood.
